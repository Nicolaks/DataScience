### Key Points for Choosing the Algorithm
- **Relationship Between Variables**: Linear algorithms are suitable for simple relationships, while non-linear algorithms handle complex ones better.
- **Data Size**: Simple models work with smaller datasets, whereas neural networks and other complex models require large data volumes.
- **Noise in Data**: If the data is noisy, choose noise-resilient algorithms like random forests or DBSCAN.
- **Task Type**: The task (regression, classification, clustering, etc.) also guides algorithm selection based on the desired output type.
- **Data Structure**: Complex structures like images and text require non-linear models, while simpler numerical or categorical data may work well with classical interpretable models.
